Machine Learning and Data Mining

This is the second weeek on my machine learning and data mining journey. 
In this week I learnt how to create and manipulate pandas Data Frames to explore data. The data used was called car insurance. A csv file.
I also Identified missing values in the dataset, and used a range of imputation strategies for both numerical and categorical variables
One hot and ordinal encoding methods were used for categorical variable
Data was standardized using normalization or min-max scaling methods
Data was also split into training and test datasets
